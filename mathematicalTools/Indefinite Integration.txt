// Indefinite Integration of a function ,which does not explode at x=0, with first linear approximation 
// Let F(x) be the indefinite integrated function of f(x)
// F(x)-F(0)= area under the curve of f(x') from x' = 0 to x 
// We calculate area of stripes and the upper triangles (Linear approximation) 
//Also the stepsizes are increased with increasing x because unless it will take a large time , which gives less accuracy in F(x) for large x ,of course, but it reduces a lot of time ...
//For more accuracy , you can reduce the power of x in the expression of h varying from 0 to 1
